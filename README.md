/_ Programmer: Marcos Ortega _/
/_ Date: December 19 2022 _/
/_ Purpose: A LargeInt class that will store large integers _/
/_ in a doubly linked list, each node containg a single digit. _/
/_ Overload operators to perform basic arithmetic using LargeInt_/
/_ objects. _/
/_ Input: n/a (Hardcoded) _/
/_ Output: Prints LargeInts computation _/

## Notes

- A friend class can access both private and protected members of the class in which it has been declared as friend.
- LargeInt doesn't need to be a template class. Will revise.
- Comment out print function in LargeInt header file. Overloaded the ostream, thus print not needed.
- ostream seems to work fine, istream needs work (24 Dec 2022).
